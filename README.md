# Assembler Graphics Library

This library is written for people who want to learn assembler with simple graphics output. The library is able to work both under the DOS operating system and on bare hardware, as it uses only BIOS interrupts.

## Features

The library currently implements the following features:
- **Shadow Buffer**: Eliminates the flicker effect.
- **Fill Screen**: Fills the screen with a color.
- **Draw Lines**: Draws straight lines.
- **Draw Rectangles**: Draws rectangles.

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements may include:
- Drawing ellipses and circles.
- Getting the color of a pixel.
- Additional minor features.

This library is a useful tool for those interested in learning assembler with practical graphics programming.
